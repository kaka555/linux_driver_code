/**
 * struct spi_master - interface to SPI master controller
 * @dev: device interface to this driver
 * @list: link with the global spi_master list
 * @bus_num: board-specific (and often SOC-specific) identifier for a
 *	given SPI controller.
 * @num_chipselect: chipselects are used to distinguish individual
 *	SPI slaves, and are numbered from zero to num_chipselects.
 *	each slave has a chipselect signal, but it's common that not
 *	every chipselect is connected to a slave.
 * @dma_alignment: SPI controller constraint on DMA buffers alignment.
 * @mode_bits: flags understood by this controller driver
 * @flags: other constraints relevant to this driver
 * @bus_lock_spinlock: spinlock for SPI bus locking
 * @bus_lock_mutex: mutex for SPI bus locking
 * @bus_lock_flag: indicates that the SPI bus is locked for exclusive use
 * @setup: updates the device mode and clocking records used by a
 *	device's SPI controller; protocol code may call this.  This
 *	must fail if an unrecognized or unsupported mode is requested.
 *	It's always safe to call this unless transfers are pending on
 *	the device whose settings are being modified.
 * @transfer: adds a message to the controller's transfer queue.
 * @cleanup: frees controller-specific state
 *
 * Each SPI master controller can communicate with one or more @spi_device
 * children.  These make a small bus, sharing MOSI, MISO and SCK signals
 * but not chip select signals.  Each device may be configured to use a
 * different clock rate, since those shared signals are ignored unless
 * the chip is selected.
 *
 * The driver for an SPI controller manages access to those devices through
 * a queue of spi_message transactions, copying data between CPU memory and
 * an SPI slave device.  For each such message it queues, it calls the
 * message's completion function when the transaction completes.
